I'm currently an 11th-grade student at Hanoi - Amsterdam High School for the Gifted. My main interests are Competitive Programming and AI, but Iâ€™m always open to learning new things. This site is where I organize my learning - sometimes polished, sometimes raw. Hope you find something useful (or at least interesting) here!
